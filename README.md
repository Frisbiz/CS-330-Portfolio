# CS-330-Portfolio

# Overview
This project focused on building a 3D scene using OpenGL, where I learned key graphical techniques like applying textures, working with lighting, and replicating complex objects using basic 3D shapes.

# How do I approach designing software?

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I learned how to apply textures and tile them seamlessly across surfaces, which was crucial for creating realistic 3D environments. I also gained experience with different lighting methods, like point lights and directional lights, to improve depth and realism. Additionally, I learned to replicate complex objects by combining simple 3D shapes.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process. I started with the basic structure and added details like textures and lighting one step at a time, testing and refining after each change. This process allowed me to make adjustments as I went and ensured the final result was visually appealing and functional.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics from my design approach, like modular coding and iterative development, will help future projects stay flexible and scalable. Breaking down tasks into smaller parts makes updates easier, and the iterative process improves quality over time. These methods will help make future work more organized and efficient.

# How do I approach developing programs?

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I applied several new strategies, including seamlessly applying textures and adjusting lighting to enhance realism. I also learned to use basic 3D shapes to build more complex objects.

- How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key to my development. As I added new elements, like textures or lights, I tested and refined the scene. Each round of adjustments helped me improve the overall look and functionality, ensuring everything fit together as intended.

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
At first, I focused on getting the basic structure right. As I progressed, I refined my code to make it more modular and efficient. This evolution helped me optimize performance and make adjustments quickly as the project came together. Towards the end it was just small tweaks and adjustments to get the look right.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics teach me how to represent data visually, which will help me in future courses related to game development or scientific visualization. This knowledge is essential for fields where understanding and presenting complex data is crucial, or just the gaming industry in general.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In my professional career pathway, the ability to work with 3D graphics and visualizations will be useful in fields like video game development, film, or virtual reality. The skills I gained will be essential for creating engaging, high-performance visual content.
